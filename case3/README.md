# Use-case 3: Classification, imjoy & python library usage

## The model

We use 10.5281/zenodo.5910855 (not on the website yet, PR: https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/pull/266).

## Usage in python library

Download and use the model, see 'test-model.py'. Currently fails due to some issues in pre-processing.
TODO define the actual use-case. Stream data from the HPA website, classify and measure statisitcs over how many classes are predicted?!

## Usage in imjoy / bioengine

TODO

## Usage in deepimagej
