# Use-case 2: Stardist model

## Apply stardist model in QuPath and correct segmentation

TODO:
- need to finish stardist integration and upload stardist models
- what model / data? MoNuSeg -> Lizard?
- need QuPath integration. If not feasible in the timeline for the preprint need to rethink this.

## Retrain with corrected segmentation in zero-cost

TODO:
- use stardist modelzoo library in zero-cost notebook

## Apply retrained model in deepimagej (and maybe also python)

TODO:
- figure out how exactly to run stardist post-processing in deepIJ
