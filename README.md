# BioImage.IO Example Applications

Use-cases for the [BioImage.IO publication](TODO). This repository contains the data, scripts and other resources for the following example applications:
- `case1-stardist`: Direct application of the pretrained StarDist H&E nucleus segmentation model.
- `case2-finetuning`: Fine-tuning of a 3d U-Net trained with zero-cost for segmentation of plant cells in light microscopy.
- `case3-devtools`: Usage of python and web developer tools to deliver the best performing entry of the Kaggle HPA segmentation challenge.
- `case4-research`: Publication of a recent method for domain adaptation using the modelzoo.

See the publication for more details and see https://bioimage.io/#/ for the modelzoo website.
